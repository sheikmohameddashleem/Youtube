## Authentication

### User Registration

User registration is a crucial feature that allows individuals to create their accounts on the platform. During registration, users provide essential information such as their username, email address, and password. This information is securely stored in the platform's database after undergoing validation checks to ensure data integrity. User registration is the initial step that enables users to access personalized features and engage with the platform's content.

### User Login

User login is a fundamental feature that allows registered users to access their accounts securely. To log in, users enter their valid credentials, typically consisting of their username or email address and password. The platform verifies these credentials against the stored user data in the database to authenticate users. Once logged in, users gain access to their personalized profiles, settings, and the ability to perform actions such as uploading videos, liking content, and leaving comments. User login is a critical aspect of the platform's security, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access specific features and data.

## User Management

### Profile Updates

Profile updates empower users to customize and maintain their profiles over time. This feature allows users to modify various aspects of their profiles, including changing their username, updating their profile picture, and adjusting account settings. These changes enable users to keep their profiles current and reflective of their preferences. Profile updates enhance the overall user experience by offering personalization options and ensuring that users' online identities remain up to date.

## Video Management

### Video Upload

Video upload is a core feature that enables users to contribute their video content to the platform. When users upload videos, the platform securely stores the video files in an Amazon S3 bucket, a robust and scalable storage solution. Simultaneously, the platform stores the video's URL and metadata in its database, making the video accessible to users. Video upload empowers users to share their content, enriching the platform's library with diverse and engaging videos.

### Video Deletion

Video deletion provides users with control over the content they've uploaded to the platform. Users with appropriate permissions can delete their videos, removing them from public view and ensuring content management. This feature is essential for content creators who want to manage their content's lifecycle and maintain a curated library of videos.

### Video Update

Video update allows users to refine and modify the details of their uploaded videos. Users can edit video titles, descriptions, and other metadata to ensure that their content remains accurate and relevant. This feature is valuable for content creators who wish to improve the discoverability and user engagement of their videos.

### Video Viewing

Video viewing is the core functionality that enables users to watch videos on the platform seamlessly. The platform typically provides a user-friendly video player that ensures an optimal viewing experience. This feature is central to the platform's purpose, as it allows users to consume content and engage with the video-sharing community.

### Liking Videos

Liking videos is an interactive feature that allows users to express their appreciation for specific videos. Users can click a "like" button associated with a video to indicate their approval and enjoyment. Liking videos contributes to the video's popularity and recommendations, making it easier for users to discover content that aligns with their preferences.

### Commenting on Videos

Commenting on videos is a social feature that fosters user engagement and interaction. Users can leave comments on videos to share their thoughts, opinions, questions, or feedback with the video's creator and the wider community. Comments create opportunities for discussions, feedback, and collaboration, enhancing the sense of community within the platform.

### Sharing Videos

Sharing videos is a convenient feature that enables users to share their favorite content with others. The platform offers various sharing options, including social media sharing and direct links. This feature encourages users to promote and distribute content, expanding the platform's reach and user engagement.

## Comments and Likes

### Adding Comments

Adding comments is an active engagement feature that allows users to participate in discussions related to videos. Users can write and submit comments expressing their thoughts, insights, and reactions to the video content. This feature encourages user interaction, facilitates discussions, and enriches the overall viewing experience.

### Managing Comments

Managing comments is an essential feature that ensures a positive and respectful environment within the platform. Admins and video owners can moderate and oversee comments to prevent the presence of inappropriate or offensive content. This moderation helps maintain a safe and enjoyable user experience, promoting healthy interactions and discussions.

### Liking and Disliking Videos

Liking and disliking videos is a feature that empowers users to indicate their preferences for specific videos. Users can express their approval or disapproval by clicking "like" or "dislike" buttons associated with videos. These user interactions influence video recommendations and provide valuable feedback to content creators, enhancing user engagement and content discoverability.

## Deployment

### Environment Configuration

Environment configuration is a critical aspect of deploying the application in a production environment. It involves setting up and configuring the production environment, ensuring optimal performance and security. Proper configuration includes considerations for security settings, API keys, and other environment-specific configurations.

### Database Setup

Database setup is essential for efficient data management and security in the production environment. It includes configuring the production database, designing an appropriate schema, optimizing indexing, and ensuring data backups and maintenance. A well-configured database is crucial for data integrity and performance in a production setting.

### Production Deployment with Spring Boot

Production deployment with Spring Boot encompasses the process of deploying the application to a production environment. It includes considerations for scalability, load balancing, high availability, and ensuring the application runs smoothly in a production setting. Proper production deployment is essential for providing a reliable and responsive user experience.
